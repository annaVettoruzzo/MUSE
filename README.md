# MUpltipleSEtsMetaParameters_MUSE

The proposed method learns multiple sets of meta-parameters (acting as different initializations of a neural network model) and uses a task encoder to select the best initialization to fine-tune for a new task.
We evaluate the proposed method on a diverse set of few-shot regression and image classification tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art meta-learning methods and the benefit of learning multiple model initializations when tasks are sampled from a multimodal task distribution.
